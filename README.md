# Vineyard Expanded and Enhanced 

This extension started as a basic extension created by kendalgotto which i loved and then wanted to add sruff onto it so it has become so much more the rest of the extension waa developed by me [reddit:u/XxIIIBanIIIxX](https://www.reddit.com/user/XxIIIBanIIIxX).

Free for personal use. Not meant to be sold.

I spent at least a hundred hours developing this extension aince i started with no coding knowledge, I am happy with what it has become. Initially, I planned to keep it to myself, but I realized it could benefit others since other have developed and release extensions for free, so I'm releasing it for everyone to enjoy.
